    <p>
        We will be sustainably extracting, storing and transporting liquified oxygen and hydrogen to our customers for a variety of purposes,
        ranging from breathable oxygen for lunar bases to fuel for rocket pit stops.
        In this way, we fill a gap in the market with a solution which would help expand space travel, using resources found abundantly and locally on the Moon.
    </p>
    <h2>What we offer</h2>
    <p>
        We offer various supply services for liquid oxygen and hydrogen, ranging from small individual supplies to commercial scaled ones.
        Our customers can choose between automated supply and a Pay-by-Tank supply, so that we can provide quality products that are more suited towards their demands.
        We recommend an automated supply subscription for lunar settlements and Pay-by-Tank supply for rocket launches.
    </p>
    <h2>Our facilities and technologies</h2>
    <img src="pics/moon_icon.png", alt="Our team", width="70%", class="center", style="max-width:600px; border-radius:7%"/>
    <p>
        We have designed several facilities to implement our extraction, storage and transport technologies, which are all closely linked together by pipes.
        The walls of all facilities are made out of microwave sintered ceramic, a material that is highly resistant to extreme temperatures.
        This provides vital structural support for our facilities, as well as shielding them from radiation in space.
        <br>
        <br>
        Oxygen is extracted from lunar regolith, which is mined by our automated mining vehicles.
        It is crushed, powdered, and is piped into the extraction facility to undergo hydrogen reduction, then electrolysis.
        The resulting oxygen gas is then piped into our storage facility, liquified, and stored in stainless steel canisters.
        Hydrogen is collected as a byproduct from the microwave sintering process, and is also liquified and stored in canisters.
        The canisters are clearly marked in coloured bands to avoid confusion and potentially dangerous mix-ups.
        <br>
        <br>
        To transport the canisters to our customers, we have developed the MoonXpress, which is a series of tracks on the lunar surface with carts that transport the canisters.
        Customers can unload full canisters from the cart and load up empty ones, sending them back to our storage facility to be refilled.
    </p>
    <h2>Customer support</h2>
    <p>
        At mO=On, we do our best to ensure our customers receive support while using our services.
        Our canisters are monitored by an ultrasonic level monitoring system, and the information can be viewed by customers via an app.
        The app can also alert customers to request a refill when it's near empty.

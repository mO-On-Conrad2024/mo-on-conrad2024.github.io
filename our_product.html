    <h1 style="text-align: center"><b>Our product</b></h1>
    <p>
        We will be sustainably extracting, storing and transporting liquified oxygen and hydrogen to our customers for a variety of purposes, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Breathable oxygen for lunar settlements.</li>
        <li>Fuel for rocket pit stops.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We fill a gap in the market with a solution which would help expand space travel loo and exploration,
        using resources found abundantly and locally on the Moon.
    </p>
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <img src="pics/canister_diagram.png", alt="Canisters", width="70%", class="center", style="max-width:600px; border-radius:7%"/>
    <div class="caption">Canisters of liquified gases that we offer</div>
    <p>
        We use canisters, manufactured on site, to store our products.
        These canisters are made of aluminium and are refilled using the bottomâ€”up filling technology.
        They are clearly marked in coloured bands (red for rxygen, white for hydrogen) to avoid confusion and potentially dangerous mix-ups.
        Our canisters have 2 sizes:
    </p>
    <h3>Large canisters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dimensions: 6m x 8m x 18m.</li>
        <li>A maximum fill volume of 840m<sup>3</sup></li>
        <li>Offers a constituent large scale and long term supply of both liquid oxygen and hydrogen.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Small canisters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dimensions: 0.5m tall, with a diameter of 0.2m.</li>
        <li>Sold in packs of 20.</li>
        <li>Small size for portability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the future we will be able to take specific customer requests for custom canister sizes.
    </p>
    <h2>Transportation</h2>
    <img src="pics/moonxpress.png", alt="mO=OnXpress", width="70%", class="center", style="max-width:600px; border-radius:7%"/>
    <div class="caption">mO=OnXpress</div>
    <p>
        To transport the canisters to our customers, we have developed mO=OnXpress:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A series of maglev tracks on the lunar surface.</li>
        <li>Carts transport the canisters straight to our customers.</li>
        <li>Full canisters are unloaded automatically from the cart and can be used immediately.</li>
        <li>Empty canisters are then loaded up and sent back to our storage facility.</li>
        <li>Carbon dioxide is also collected in canisters from Lunar Settlements and is recycled by us.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Refills</h2>
    <p>
        Our customers can choose between two refill systems depending on their needs:
    </p>
    <h3>Automated Refill Service</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Canisters are replaced automatically when near empty.</li>
        <li>Most suited to those who need a regular supply of oxygen or hydrogen, such as lunar settlements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pay-by-Canister</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Customers order one canister at a time.</li>
        <li>They are responsible for ordering a new delivery when their current canister is nearly empty.</li>
        <li>Most suited to those who need a one-off supply of oxygen or hydrogen, such as fuelling a rocket.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pricing and customer support</h2>
    <p>
        At mO=On we work with our customers in mind. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We aim to offer low prices, which then means:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's more financially sustainable for our customers to continue buying from us.</li>
        <li>It ensures that we remain competitive in our field.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pricing</h3>
    <p>
        Oxygen will be sold at $1250 per kg.
        <br>
        <br>
        Hydrogen will be sold at $1750 per kg.
        <br>
        <br>
        Canister Adaptors will also be available in the coming years. These will be sold at $2,000 per adaptor.
    </p>
    <h3>Customer support</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Our on-site team will be available to respond to any queries, and they'll also get in touch if there is a situation that requires the customer's attention.</li>
        <li>Our canisters are monitored by an ultrasonic level monitoring system.</li>
        <li>Information about a customers canisters and orders can be viewed by customers via an app.</li>
        <li>The app can also remind customers to request a refill when it's near empty.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our facilities</h2>
    <img src="pics/process_diagram.png", alt="mO=On facilities process diagram", width="70%", class="center", style="max-width:600px; border-radius:7%"/>
    <div class="caption">Diagram of the processes involved in our technology</div>
    <p>We have designed several facilities to implement our extraction, storage and sport technologies, which are all closely linked together by pipes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The walls of all facilities are made out of microwave sintered ceramic.</li>
        <li>This is a material that is highly resistant to extreme temperatures.</li>
        <li>This provides vital structural support for our facilities, shielding them from radiation in space.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We also have a crew of trained astronauts on site, who will:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Constantly monitor the performance of our facilities.</li>
        <li>Respond to any minor, unexpected incidents.</li>
        <li>Communicate closely with our customers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Our facilities are located at the south pole of the Moon, allowing us to place solar panels which will generate electricity constantly to power our facilities.
        <br>
        <br>
        We plan to build a second, backup storage facility shortly after the startup of our business, which will store extra canisters which can be delivered to customers in case of an emergency.
        <br>
        <br>
        Routine maintenance is also planned within our business, and we make sure that our equipment is replaced regularly to prevent degradation from affecting the quality of our products.
    </p>
    <h2>Our technology</h2>
    <p>Here is a summary of our process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Oxygen is extracted from lunar regolith by going through a hydrogen reduction reaction followed by electrolysis.</li>
        <li>The resulting oxygen gas is then piped into our storage facility, liquified, and stored in canisters.</li>
        <li>Hydrogen is collected as a byproduct from the microwave sintering process.</li>
        <li>It is also liquified and stored in canisters.</li>
        <li>The canisters are manufactured on site, using aluminium which is produced a byproduct of hydrogen reduction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In order to protect our intellectual property and to gain the trust of our customers, mO=On invests a significant amount of funds in security. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Our facilities are kept secure by controlled gates and security cameras.</li>
        <li>Our technology is also kept safe by patenting and also by investing in cybersecurity services.</li>
    </ul>

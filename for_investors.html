    <p>
        Here at mO=On, not only do we have an idea for an innovative solution addressing one of the prominent issues in space travel,
        we also have a well thought out business plan that ensures our costs are well covered by our revenue.

    <div class="caption">A graph of our projected finances. Inflation and unforeseen circumstances have already been considered as part of our projected costs.</div>
    <p>
        Our projected startup cost is about $12.5 billion, with our startup funding invested in areas including but not limited to building our facilities,
        setting up mO=OnXpress for transportation of our products, and purchasing lunar solar cells to produce the electricity needed for our facilities to operate.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our main stream of revenue comes from selling oxygen to lunar settlements.
        Selling liquified oxygen and hydrogen as rocket fuel, despite being a more competitive field, will also be an important source of income in our business.
        By Year 5, as part of the planned expansion of our business, we will also be selling canister adaptors as another income stream.
        <br>
        <br>
        As an investor, you can expect to be paid back over 7 times your initial investment in 7 years.
        Our design costs also allow for an investor to buy up to 22% of our shares.

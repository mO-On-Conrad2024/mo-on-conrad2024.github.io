    <h1 style="text-align: center"><b>For investors</b></h1>
    <p>
        Here at mO=On, not only do we have an idea for an innovative solution addressing one of the prominent issues in space travel,
        we also have a well thought out business plan that ensures our costs are well covered by our revenue.
    </p>
    <h2>Partnerships</h2>
    <p>
        As part of our business, we're looking to form partnerships with space agencies, our targeted initial customers. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In exchange for lower prices on our products, we hope to be able to secure a standby rocket.
        This will guarantee us a secure and robust method to transport our equipment to the Moon and take trips for maintenance. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Within the partnership we also hope to exchange skills between our team and other astronauts within the agency.
        With this collaboration we'll be able to assemble and hire a trained crew specialising in all essential fields who can then help monitor our facilities.
    </p>
    <h2>Finances</h2>
    <p>
        Our projected startup cost is about $12.4 billion, with our startup funding invested in several areas including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Building our facilities</li>
        <li>Setting up mO=OnXpress</li>
        <li>Purchasing lunar solar cells</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Our main stream of revenue comes from selling oxygen to lunar settlements.
        <br>
        <br>
        Selling liquid oxygen and hydrogen as rocket fuel, despite being a more competitive field, will also be an important source of income in our business. 
        <br>
        <br>
        By Year 5, as part of the planned expansion of our business, we will also be selling canister adaptors as another income stream.
        As an investor, you can expect to be paid back over 8 times your initial investment in 7 years.
        Investors will also have the opportunity to receive a 22% share of our company's profits.
    </p>
    <h2>Business phases</h2>
    <p>
        In order to organise our business into development stages, we have come up with 5 phases for our first 7 years of development.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each phase has a particular expansion goal that we aim to achieve.</li>
        <li>We are projected to earn profit consistently throughout each phase.</li>
        <li>The accumulating profits allows us flexibility in terms of our next stage of development.</li>
        <li>After these initial phases, we will also be able to expand our business according to needs at that time.</li>
    </ul>

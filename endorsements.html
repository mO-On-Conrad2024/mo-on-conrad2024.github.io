    <p>"Huge congratulations to the four students in the mO=On team from Oxford High School GDST,
        who have been selected as finalists of the Conrad Challenge,
        a global innovation competition creating the next generation of entrepreneurs who will change the world!
        The mO=On team reached the finals based on their idea to provide a sustainable service to extract, store and transport liquid oxygen and hydrogen to customers on the Moon.
        They aim to provide gases to fuel trips from the Moon to Mars, and to enable humans to live in lunar settlements.
        <br>
        Surrey Space Centre's expert on lunar construction and in-situ resource utilisation, Dr Sungwoo Lim,
        was one of the team's advisers, but he gives all credit to the student team.
        They'll be heading to the 2025 Innovation Summit which takes place over four days at Space Center Houston and NASA's Johnson Space Center next month.
        We think they're going to have a fantastic time!"</p>

        “Listening to the project pitch and speaking to the team, I was impressed by the level of knowledge demonstrated,
        coupled with the understanding and attention to detail applied to all aspects of the unit operations,
        to produce and transport oxygen on the moon.
        Also, like any successful team, the enthusiasm for the subject and bond between the members was apparent.
        A further strength of the group is in their diversity, in that they cover a variety of academic disciplines,
        offering a broad range of skills and perspectives, in terms of generating ideas and problem solving.”

        “I'm particularly impressed by the team's expertise in the subject matter.
        It's clear that you all have a deep understanding of the moon and its resources, which is essential for creating a compelling product.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “The use of graphics, product videos, and a website to enhance credibility is also noteworthy.
        These elements not only add visual appeal to your product but also provide a clear and concise way to present complex information.
        It's great to see the team create this comprehensive and engaging presentation.”

        “I am thrilled to provide feedback on this revolutionary concept!
        It's a game-changer, indeed, and has the potential to reshape our universe as we know it. Here's why:
        <br>
        Game-Changing Innovation: This concept has the potential to disrupt the status quo and create a paradigm shift in space habitation and exploration.
        The innovative approach and cutting-edge technology behind your product are truly remarkable.
        <br>
        Meaningful Impact: As you've highlighted, this product has the potential to create a significant, long-lasting impact on humanity.
        The benefits it will bring to people's lives on the moon and beyond are truly unparalleled.
        <br>
        Inspirational and Educational: The innovative design and technology behind this concept will undoubtedly inspire and educate people,
        sparking a new wave of creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship.
        It will also raise awareness about the importance of space exploration. The possibilities are endless.
        <br>
        A Bright Future Ahead: In conclusion, this concept is a beacon of hope for a brighter future.
        It's a testament to human ingenuity and creativity.”

        “The team has to assume a lot in this area of the project since no one is currently living on the moon.
        It's apparent that a lot of research has been done to learn the best method of creating this sustainable product on the moon.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “The team has demonstrated that they understand the potential customers of the product. It's a very captive customer set.
        The customer will still have options to buy oxygen elsewhere, but the team has a plan for being the lowest cost supplier.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “I am very impressed by your line-item summary of expenses and revenue.
        I can see that you have taken a lot of time to analyze your business model/strategy.”

    <h2 style="text-align: center">We are mO=On, a Conrad Challenge 2024-2025 team of four from Oxford High School.</h2>
    <p>
        Our team consists of a group of students who came together through a shared passion for space.
        <br>
        <br>
        Although as individuals we have different areas of expertise, our diverse specialist interests complement one another to form mO=On.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our passion for sustainability, research and exploration motivates us, as we share our fascination for space and are passionate about developing an important innovation for future space exploration.
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Our mission</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide a service to sustainably extract, store and transport liquified oxygen and hydrogen</li>
        <li>Sourcing any materials used directly from the Moon's surface</li>
        <li>Sell the liquified gases to customers for a variety of purposes to aid lunar exploration, ranging from breathable oxygen to rocket fuel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We envision our innovative solution to be able to provide a reliable oxygen and hydrogen supply,
        laying the foundations for a future successful moon base,
        and solve the problem where lots of money is being spent to transport huge amounts of gases to the Moon.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sustainability is one of our main core values, so we make sure that we reuse the byproducts of our reactions as much as possible.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the future, we also aim to be able to fund research into creating an oxygen cycle on the Moon,
        making this process sustainable and minimising any permanent harm done to the Moon.

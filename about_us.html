    <p>We are mO=On, a Conrad Challenge 2024-2025 team of four from Oxford High School. 
        <br>Our mission is to provide a service to efficiently and safely transport and store oxygen once it has been extracted from the moon's surface.
        This oxygen can then be sold to space agencies to use for a variety of purposes to aid moon exploration.
        <br>We envision our innovative solution to be able to provide a reliable and sustainable oxygen supply,
        laying the foundations for a future successful moon base,
        and solve the problem where lots of money is being spent to transport huge amounts of oxygen to the moon.
        <br>Sustainability is one of our main core values, so we also aim to find a way to create an oxygen cycle on the moon,
        making this process sustainable and minimising any permanent harm done to the moon.
